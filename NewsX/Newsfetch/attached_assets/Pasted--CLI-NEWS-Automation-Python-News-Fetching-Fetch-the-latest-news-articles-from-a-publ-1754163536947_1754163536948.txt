#CLI NEWS Automation, Python.

## News Fetching:

        Fetch the latest news articles from a public API like NewsAPI or any other news source.

        Support filtering news by topics, regions, and/or keywords.
### 1. Choose a News Source (API)

    NewsAPI: A popular API for fetching news from various sources around the world.

    Other Sources: You could also use other services like Google News, NY Times API, or custom scrapers if needed.

2. Define the Parameters

You can customize the news you fetch based on various filters:

    Keywords: Search news based on specific keywords (e.g., "technology", "economy").

    Categories: Fetch news based on specific categories such as business, sports, health, general, etc.

    Country: You can limit news to a specific region by using country codes (e.g., US, UK, DE).

    Language: You can filter news based on the language of articles (e.g., English, Spanish).

3. Make a Request

    A request is made to the API to retrieve the latest news articles based on the specified filters.

    The request includes:

        API key (authentication to prove you're a valid user).

        Filters (keywords, country, category, etc.).

4. Get the Response

    The API responds with a JSON object containing news articles.

    Each article usually includes:

        Title: The headline of the article.

        Description: A brief summary of the article.

        URL: A link to the full article.

        Source: The publication source (e.g., BBC, CNN).

        Published At: Timestamp of when the article was published.

5. Handle the Response

    The response can be parsed and filtered based on your needs.

    If the request is successful, you will have a list of articles that match your search criteria.

6. Display the Articles

    Once the articles are fetched, they are displayed or logged as per the system's requirements.

    You may display the title and description, or even the full article text if needed.

Example Scenarios

    Fetch Technology News: You make a request to the API with the category set to "technology" and country as "US". The API returns the latest articles related to technology from US-based sources.

    Fetch News About AI: You make a request with a query like "AI" and the country set to "us". This fetches articles that mention or cover artificial intelligence.

    Fetch Top Headlines: Without any filters, you can get the top headlines from the world (or a specific country) for the day.

Common Filters You Can Use

    query: A keyword or phrase for news filtering (e.g., "Bitcoin", "Election").

    country: Limit the news to a specific country (e.g., "us" for USA, "gb" for Great Britain).

    category: Predefined categories of news (e.g., "sports", "business").

    language: Filter articles by language (e.g., "en" for English).

    date: Get articles from a specific date range (e.g., articles from the last 24 hours).

How it Works in Real Life

    News API receives a request from your application.

    It queries its news sources for recent articles matching your filters.

    The articles are returned as a list of JSON objects, each containing metadata (title, description, URL).

    You can then decide how to handle, display, or store these articles.
