## 📈 Progress Tracking Workflow

### Daily Routine
1. **Morning** (9:00 AM):
   - Review today's tasks in weekly tracker
   - Update daily goals based on priorities
   - Check any blockers from previous day

2. **During Development**:
   - Check off tasks as completed `[x]`
   - Add notes for important decisions
   - Log any issues or blockers

3. **End of Day** (5:00 PM):
   - Update progress in both tracking files
   - Prepare tomorrow's tasks
   - Run `python project_tracker.py status` for quick check

### Weekly Routine
1. **Monday Morning**:
   - Create new weekly tracker: `python project_tracker.py weekly`
   - Review previous week's achievements
   - Plan current week based on main development plan

2. **Friday Afternoon**:
   - Complete weekly retrospective
   - Generate status report: `python project_tracker.py report`
   - Update project config if needed
   - Plan next week's priorities

### Monthly Review
1. **Generate Progress Export**:
   ```bash
   python project_tracker.py export
   ```

2. **Review Velocity Metrics**:
   ```bash
   python project_tracker.py velocity
   ```

3. **Update Project Config**:
   - Adjust timelines if needed
   - Update technology decisions
   - Review and update risks

## 🎨 Customization Guide

### Adding New Tasks
1. **In Main Plan**: Add under appropriate phase with checkbox format
   ```markdown
   - [ ] **New Task Name** (estimated_time)
     - [ ] Subtask 1
     - [ ] Subtask 2
   ```

2. **In Weekly Tracker**: Add to daily sections
   ```markdown
   - [ ] New daily task with completion time
   ```

### Modifying Phases
1. Update `project_config.json`:
   ```json
   "phases": {
     "new_phase": {
       "name": "New Phase Name",
       "duration_weeks": 4,
       "status": "not_started",
       "priority": "high"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Add corresponding section in main development plan

### Custom Metrics
Add to `project_config.json` under `success_metrics`:
```json
"custom_metrics": {
  "code_quality": ">95%",
  "documentation_coverage": "100%"
}
```

## 📊 Understanding Progress Indicators

### Task Status Icons
- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[x]` - Completed
- `⏳` - In progress
- `🟡` - In progress (visual indicator)
- `✅` - Completed (visual indicator)
- `❌` - Not started (visual indicator)
- `🔴` - Blocked
- `⚠️` - Partially completed

### Phase Status
- **Planning** ✅ - Requirements and design complete
- **In Progress** 🟡 - Active development
- **Completed** ✅ - All tasks done and tested
- **Blocked** 🔴 - Cannot proceed due to dependencies

### Priority Levels
- **High** 🔴 - Critical path items
- **Medium** 🟡 - Important but flexible timing
- **Low** 🟢 - Nice to have features

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Task not found when updating**:
   - Check exact task description spelling
   - Ensure task exists in the file
   - Use partial matching if needed

2. **Progress percentages seem wrong**:
   - Verify all checkboxes use correct format `- [x]` or `- [ ]`
   - Check for any formatting inconsistencies

3. **Weekly tracker creation fails**:
   - Ensure template file exists
   - Check file permissions
   - Verify date format

### Getting Help
- Review this README
- Check task descriptions in main plan
- Use `python project_tracker.py --help` for command options

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Task Management
1. **Be Specific**: Write clear, actionable task descriptions
2. **Time Estimates**: Include realistic time estimates
3. **Dependencies**: Note task dependencies clearly
4. **Regular Updates**: Update progress at least daily

### Documentation
1. **Decision Logging**: Record important technical decisions
2. **Blocker Tracking**: Document and track blockers immediately
3. **Retrospectives**: Conduct honest weekly retrospectives

### Code Quality
1. **Check Before Commit**: Ensure tasks are actually complete
2. **Test Coverage**: Don't mark testing tasks complete without proper coverage
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation as you complete features
